This is a chess game with a UI still being developed. A simple usable UI has been developed 
to allow for testing game play. The program is written in Java with some extra features such 
as a "Checker" piece that can be added for additional game play and an "Undo" button to revert
a move. A JUnit test suite has also been written to maintain code usage.
